# What-I-Learned-Week-9
What I learned this week: 
I learned that if you put 'cal' into the terminal that you will get the actual calendar displayed in you terminal. 

I learned that before working you should plan out the logic first before you do anything. 

I tried to grasp setInterval, but I didn't understand the concept.

[3] and [3] are not the same in Javascript.

We learned about throw statements, but I didn't really catch that either.
